BUGS


REQUIRED
    use an asic "secure" algorithm (similar to scrypt / the ones X11 uses, but NOT the same)
    if there's ever a new version which generates other passwords,

    README screenshots for gui version have to be redone

    add new password types (TYPE A: letters, numbers, symbols, both lower and upper case max 15 chars? | TYPE B: like A, without special chars)

    display pwlongnospecial pwshort and pwshortnospecial aswell

    remae ROUNDS to HASHING_ROUNDS

    add constant which defines how often the master seed is used

    find good values for memory and cpu contants

    rename master salt to master seed

    once everything is set up, generate some passwords and add version_5 tests for them to make sure they generate the same pw on all platforms / future versions

NICE-TO-HAVE
    a logo

    add info box similar to console version to the gui version

    allow import / export of accounts in qt version
