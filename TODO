BUGS:


REQUIRED
    the readme needs a rework

    if there's ever a new version which generates other passwords,
    add a determ-pwgen specific seed which contains e.g. "determ-pwgen...RANDOM_DATA"

NICE-TO-HAVE
    a logo

    rename form1

    add info box similar to console version to the gui version

    allow import / export of accounts in qt version

    make everything work in py3 aswell
