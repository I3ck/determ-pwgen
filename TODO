    if there's ever a new version which generates other passwords,

    README screenshots for gui version have to be redone

    add new password types (TYPE A: letters, numbers, symbols, both lower and upper case max 15 chars? | TYPE B: like A, without special chars)

    display pwlongnospecial pwshort and pwshortnospecial aswell

    remae ROUNDS to HASHING_ROUNDS

    add constant which defines how often the master seed is used

    find good values for memory and cpu contants

    rename master salt to master seed

    add unit tests for Password and the generator (define some required, generated pws which will make it easier to test changes later on)
    test generation algorithms
    test that Password("abc") generates mixed case passwords and passwords with special chars

NICE-TO-HAVE
    a logo
