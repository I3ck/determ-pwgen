add info box similar to console version to the gui version

allow import / export of accounts in qt version

make everything work in py3 aswell

improve generate codebase (some parts used multiple times / naming of methods not too great)

the readme needs a rework

if there's ever a new version which generates other passwords,
add a determ-pwgen specific seed which contains e.g. "determ-pwgen...RANDOM_DATA"

clicking the password field should auto select all text (or add a "copy to clipboard" button)

rename "password for ..." to "Password for ..." in gui
