make everything work in py3 aswell

make table rows / cells read only

the readme needs a rework

the cli version should have another mode, where all accounts in accounts.json are listed with numbers
[1] one@host
[2] tooo@hest
[3] tree@forest
etc. where the user then can specify which one to generate by typing the number
add leading white spaces there
[  1] a
[530] b

cli version also needs checks for the case where seed1 or 2 are empty

if there's ever a new version which generates other passwords,
add a determ-pwgen specific seed which contains e.g. "determ-pwgen...RANDOM_DATA"
