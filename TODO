BUGS:


REQUIRED:

    the readme needs a rework

    if there's ever a new version which generates other passwords,
    add a determ-pwgen specific seed which contains e.g. "determ-pwgen...RANDOM_DATA"

    clicking the password field should auto select all text (or add a "copy to clipboard" button)

    rename "password for ..." to "Password for ..." in gui

NICE-TO-HAVE:
    a logo

    add info box similar to console version to the gui version

    allow import / export of accounts in qt version

    make everything work in py3 aswell
