BUGS


REQUIRED
    use an asic "secure" algorithm (similar to scrypt / the ones X11 uses, but NOT the same)
    if there's ever a new version which generates other passwords,
    add a determ-pwgen specific seed which contains e.g. "determ-pwgen...RANDOM_DATA"

    README screenshots for gui version have to be redone

    add new password types (TYPE A: letters, numbers, symbols, both lower and upper case max 15 chars? | TYPE B: like A, without special chars)

NICE-TO-HAVE
    a logo

    add info box similar to console version to the gui version

    allow import / export of accounts in qt version

    make everything work in py3 aswell
